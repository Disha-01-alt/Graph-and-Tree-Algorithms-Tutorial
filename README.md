# ðŸ“˜ Graph and Tree Algorithms Tutorial

This Jupyter Notebook is a complete tutorial on fundamental **graph and tree algorithms** using Python. It's designed for learners aiming to build strong foundations in graph theory with practical code examples and visual understanding.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

1. **Degree of Vertices** â€“ Calculate degree of each node.
2. **Graph Representation Conversion**
   - Adjacency Matrix â†” Adjacency List â†” Edge List
3. **Adjacency Check** â€“ Check if two vertices are adjacent.
4. **Completeness Check** â€“ Is the graph complete?
5. **Connectivity Check** â€“ Is the graph connected?
6. **Walk / Trail / Path Checker** â€“ Validate sequences as walk, trail, or path.
7. **Tree Detection** â€“ Check if a graph is a tree.
8. **Spanning Tree Extraction** â€“ Generate a spanning tree.
9. **Leaf Node Count** â€“ Count number of leaf nodes in a tree.
10. **Binary Tree Check** â€“ Determine if a tree is binary.
11. **Tree Height** â€“ Compute height of a tree.
12. **Node Depth** â€“ Find depth of a specific node.
